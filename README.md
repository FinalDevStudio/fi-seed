A boilerplate for MEAN applications

Remember to run `npm install` and `bower install` after cloning.

You will need [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/) (with **npm** of course), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads), [Redis](http://redis.io/download) and a global installation of [Bower](http://bower.io/) is recommended.

> Happy noding!
